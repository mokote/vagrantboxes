Mokote Vagrant Boxes
====================

We're using Vagrant actively, that's why we've got our own templates for Packer to generate virtual boxes on demand.

All boxes have virtual machine guest tools preinstalled to provide seamless integration with the host machine.

Feel free to send us any feedback here or file an issue.

Please take a look at [https://app.vagrantup.com/mokote/](https://app.vagrantup.com/mokote/) for available boxes.

Usage

See [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html) for more details.
